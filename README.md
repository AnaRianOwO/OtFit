## What is OtFit?

OtFit is a mobile application that helps users discover outfit combinations from their own wardrobe. Users upload photos of their clothing items, and the app uses AI to analyze them and suggest complete, coherent outfits based on what they already own.

No more standing in front of your closet not knowing what to wear.
